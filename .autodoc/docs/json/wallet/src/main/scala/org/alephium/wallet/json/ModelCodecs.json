  "summary": "This code defines a set of implicit JSON codecs for various models used in the Oxyg3nium wallet. These codecs allow for easy serialization and deserialization of these models to and from JSON format. \n\nThe `ModelCodecs` trait extends the `ApiModelCodec` trait and defines implicit codecs for the following models: `Addresses`, `AddressInfo`, `MinerAddressesInfo`, `Balances.AddressBalance`, `Balances`, `ChangeActiveAddress`, `Transfer`, `Sign`, `SignResult`, `Sweep`, `TransferResult`, `TransferResults`, `Mnemonic`, `WalletUnlock`, `WalletDeletion`, `WalletRestore`, `WalletRestoreResult`, `WalletCreation`, `WalletCreationResult`, `WalletStatus`, `RevealMnemonic`, and `RevealMnemonicResult`. \n\nFor example, the `addressesRW` codec is defined for the `Addresses` model, which represents a list of addresses. This codec is defined using the `macroRW` macro, which generates a read-write codec for the model based on its case class definition. \n\nThese codecs are used throughout the Oxyg3nium wallet to serialize and deserialize JSON data for various API requests and responses. For example, the `transferRW` codec is used to serialize a `Transfer` model to JSON when making a transfer request to the Oxyg3nium API. \n\nOverall, this code plays an important role in enabling communication between the Oxyg3nium wallet and the Oxyg3nium API by providing a standardized way to encode and decode data in JSON format.",
