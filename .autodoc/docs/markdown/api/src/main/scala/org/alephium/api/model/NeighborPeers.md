This code defines a case class called `NeighborPeers` that contains a vector of `BrokerInfo` objects. The purpose of this class is to represent a list of neighboring peers in the Oxyg3nium network. 

The `BrokerInfo` class is defined in the `org.oxyg3nium.protocol.model` package and contains information about a broker node in the Oxyg3nium network, such as its IP address and port number. The `AVector` class is defined in the `org.oxyg3nium.util` package and is a custom implementation of an immutable vector data structure.

By encapsulating a vector of `BrokerInfo` objects in a case class, this code provides a convenient way to pass around a list of neighboring peers in the Oxyg3nium network. For example, this class could be used in the implementation of a peer discovery algorithm that allows nodes to find and connect to other nodes in the network.

Here is an example of how this class could be used:

```scala
import org.oxyg3nium.api.model.NeighborPeers
import org.oxyg3nium.protocol.model.BrokerInfo
import org.oxyg3nium.util.AVector

// create a vector of BrokerInfo objects
val brokers = AVector(BrokerInfo("192.168.1.1", 1234), BrokerInfo("192.168.1.2", 5678))

// create a NeighborPeers object from the vector
val neighborPeers = NeighborPeers(brokers)

// print out the list of peers
println(neighborPeers.peers)
```

This would output:

```
Vector(BrokerInfo(192.168.1.1,1234), BrokerInfo(192.168.1.2,5678))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NeighborPeers` case class?
   - The `NeighborPeers` case class is used to represent a list of neighboring peers in the Oxyg3nium network, with each peer being represented by a `BrokerInfo` object.

2. What is the significance of the `AVector` type used in the `NeighborPeers` class?
   - The `AVector` type is a custom vector implementation used in the Oxyg3nium project, which provides efficient and immutable vector operations.

3. What is the expected input and output of functions that use the `NeighborPeers` class?
   - Functions that use the `NeighborPeers` class are expected to take an instance of the class as input and return a modified or filtered instance of the class as output, depending on the specific use case.
