This code is a configuration file for Prometheus, a monitoring and alerting system. The purpose of this file is to define how Prometheus should scrape data from a target, in this case, the Oxyg3nium application. 

The `global` section sets the default scrape interval and evaluation interval to 15 seconds. It also sets the external label for all time series and alerts to 'oxyg3nium'. 

The `scrape_configs` section defines the job name as 'oxyg3nium' and sets the scrape interval to 15 seconds. The `static_configs` section specifies the target to be scraped, which is the Oxyg3nium application running on port 12973. It also adds a label 'app' with the value 'oxyg3nium' to all scraped time series and alerts. 

This configuration file can be used in the larger Oxyg3nium project to monitor the performance and health of the application. Prometheus will scrape metrics from the Oxyg3nium application at the defined interval and store them in a time series database. These metrics can then be visualized and analyzed using Prometheus' built-in query language, or used to trigger alerts based on predefined rules. 

Example usage of this configuration file in the Oxyg3nium project:

```
# Start Prometheus with the oxyg3nium.yml configuration file
prometheus --config.file=oxyg3nium.yml

# Access the Prometheus web UI to view metrics and alerts
http://localhost:9090/
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `global` section in this code?
    
    The `global` section sets default values for scrape and evaluation intervals, and scrape timeout. 

2. What is the purpose of the `external_labels` section in this code?
    
    The `external_labels` section attaches labels to time series or alerts when communicating with external systems like federation, remote storage, or Alertmanager. In this case, the label `monitoring` is set to `'oxyg3nium'`.

3. What is the purpose of the `scrape_configs` section in this code?
    
    The `scrape_configs` section contains the configuration for scraping a specific endpoint, in this case, Prometheus itself. It sets the job name, scrape interval, and targets to scrape. In this case, the target is `'oxyg3nium:12973'` and the label `app` is set to `'oxyg3nium'`.
