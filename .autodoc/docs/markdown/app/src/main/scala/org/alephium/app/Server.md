This code defines a trait called `Server` that is used to create a server for the Oxyg3nium project. The `Server` trait is a service that can be started and stopped. It defines several abstract methods and values that must be implemented by any concrete implementation of the trait. 

The `Server` trait requires an `ActorSystem` and an `ExecutionContext` to be defined. It also requires an `Oxyg3niumConfig` and an `ApiConfig` to be defined. The `Oxyg3niumConfig` is a configuration object that contains various settings for the Oxyg3nium project, such as network settings and mining settings. The `ApiConfig` is a configuration object that contains settings for the API that the server will expose.

The `Server` trait defines several lazy values that are used to create the server. The `node` value is an instance of the `Node` class, which is used to interact with the Oxyg3nium network. The `walletApp` value is an optional instance of the `WalletApp` class, which is used to manage wallets. The `blocksExporter` value is an instance of the `BlocksExporter` class, which is used to export blocks from the Oxyg3nium network.

The `restServer` value is an instance of the `RestServer` class, which is used to expose a REST API for the Oxyg3nium network. The `webSocketServer` value is an instance of the `WebSocketServer` class, which is used to expose a WebSocket API for the Oxyg3nium network. The `walletService` value is an optional instance of the `WalletService` class, which is used to manage wallets.

The `miner` value is an instance of the `CpuMiner` class, which is used to mine blocks on the Oxyg3nium network. The `startSelfOnce` method is used to start the `MinerApiController`, which is an actor that exposes an API for the miner. The `stopSelfOnce` method is used to stop the `Server`.

The `Server` trait is implemented by the `Impl` class, which takes a `rootPath` and an `ActorSystem` as parameters. The `Impl` class defines the `dbPath`, `storageFolder`, and `writeOptions` values, which are used to create the `Storages` instance. The `blocksExporter` value is also defined in the `Impl` class. 

Overall, this code defines a trait that is used to create a server for the Oxyg3nium project. The server exposes a REST API, a WebSocket API, and a wallet management API. It also includes a miner that can be used to mine blocks on the Oxyg3nium network.
